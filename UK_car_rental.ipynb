    "A friend of ours approached us and wants to sell his old used car, being a VW Golf. He was excited about the Data Science programme at LSE and was convinced that we can leverage our Data Science skills to help him understand the UK used-car market better. (1) In general, he wants  to have more knowledge about what influences the UK used-car market overall. (2) Secondly it would be valuable for him to understand what car features overall are important when selling his car. (3) Seeing as though our friend has a VW Golf, it would be useful for us to shed light on which factors effect this specific segment of the market as well. Finally, he would like to have a rough estimate of a sales price.\n",

    "To address his request, we hypothesized that, alongside vehicle-specific attributes such as mileage or engine size, broader economic and environmental factors might play a significant role in shaping the UK used-car market. To validate this hypothesis and provide structured insights for our friend, we utilized several datasets and designed a comprehensive research approach."

    "Therefore, we structured our research in the following way:\n",
    "1. ALL: UK Used-Car Market and Economic Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we analyzed the overall trends in the UK used-car market to understand its development over the years. This high-level analysis aims to identify anomalies or irregularities over specific timeframes. Furthermore, by incorporating economic indicators for the UK, such as inflation rates or unemployment levels, we sought to uncover correlations or influences between these factors and the used-car market. This foundational analysis provides context for how external economic conditions shape market behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SAMPLE: Sample Analysis of the UK Used-Car Market\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is impractical to analyze every used car sold in the UK, we utilized a representative sample of approximately 100,000 used cars to derive actionable insights. This dataset allowed us to investigate the relationships between car-specific features such as mileage, transmission type, fuel type, MPG, engine size, and price. By understanding these correlations, we identified key factors that are critical to consider when evaluating the value of a used car.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GOLF: VW Golf and Environmental Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we focused on the VW Golf segment, narrowing our scope to our friendâ€™s specific car. Alongside the car-specific features analyzed in the broader market study, we incorporated emissions data to evaluate its impact on the pricing of a VW Golf. This analysis enabled us to identify additional factors that influence the valuation of this specific model. Using a linear regression model, we derived a data-driven estimation of the car's potential sales price. This final step combines insights from both high-level market trends and segment-specific characteristics to provide a precise recommendation."

This is done by gathering the PDFs published by Volkswagen themselves and manually retrieving the emissions levels for each kind, or setup, of car in the data set. These emissions levels are measured in grams per kilometer of carbon dioxide. This 'setup' is determined by four categorical variables: year of make, fuel type, transmission, and engine size. Due to limitations in the catalogues themselves, criteria such as fuel type are restricted to just 'Petrol' and 'Diesel', engine size to 1.0, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 2.0 litres, and transmission to 'Manual' and 'Automatic'.

    "Beginning with high-level data, we examined economic indicators such as unemployment rates and the Consumer Prices Index including Housing (CPIH) in relation to car sales volumes, specifically analyzing the periods around 2015 and 2020. Our analysis revealed a negative correlation between unemployment rates and the used car CPIH, while the general CPIH positively correlates with the used car CPIH, highlighting the interplay between economic conditions and market behavior.\n",

    "**2. SAMPLE: UK Used Cars** <br>\n",
    "We further segmented the UK used-car market into three price clustersâ€”lower, mid, and upper segments. Notably, the Volkswagen Golf, a mid-segment car, emerged as a key focus of our research. In addition to that we can see the average prices of other car makes and their average mileages which enables our friend to see where his VW Golf is located within the market. By analyzing price-to-mileage ratios across all cars, we observed that most vehicles have a price/mileage index between 0 and 2, offering a benchmark for evaluating a fair market price. \n",

    "**3. GOLF: Environmental Factors of VW Golf CO2 Emissions** <br>\n",
    "Diving deeper to the specific case of our friend's VW Golf, we identified key factors influencing car prices: CO2 emissions, annual tax, and the carâ€™s manufacturing year were positively correlated with price, whereas mileage had a significant negative impact. This shows that our friend should be mostly concerned about the mentioned features as they are the most crucial when it comes to a selling price. Synthesizing insights from both high-level economic data and granular vehicle-specific data, we provided a tailored tipps and facts to keep in mind for our friend selling his Volkswagen Golf. Based on the carâ€™s attributes and our regression analysis (based on other VW Golfs from 2015 to 2020), we estimate its market value to be approximately Â£19,077. \n",

    "**4. Limitations and Improvements** <br>\n",
    "Looking ahead, future analyses could be enriched by incorporating more comprehensive emissions data beyond CO2, and including location and time-of-sale variables in used-car market data. These additions would provide deeper context and allow for even more robust predictive modeling. By combining multiple data sources and employing statistical and machine learning techniques, we have not only offered a potential sales price but also demonstrated how data-driven insights can empower sellers to make informed decisions in the used-car market."
